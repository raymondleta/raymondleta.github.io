      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>My name is <span class="name">Raymond Gitonga </span>a coding student at the Moringa school. I have a background in Law being a recent graduate
      from the University of Nairobi. I have previously worked at the Meru High Court and at The Kenya Law Reform Commission. </p>
      <p>I have had a passion for coding and software development for a long time and i have also tried to self teach myself how
      to code however school commitments and lack of a developer community to assist in learning i frequently gave up. The main reason why
      i joined Moringa was to not only learn code but also be able to build a startup that i've been trying to launch, the other
      reason is so i can be able to understand my friends' developer insider jokes.   </p>
      <p> I love writting, my hobbies include reading, script writting and videography and making jigsaw puzzles in my free time.
      i also collect funko pops. </p>
