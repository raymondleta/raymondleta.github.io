      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is <span class="name">Raymond Gitonga </span>a coding student at the Moringa school. I have a background in Law being a recent graduate
      from the University of Nairobi. I have previously worked at the Meru High Court and at The Kenya Law Reform Commission. </p>
      <p>I have had a passion for coding and software development for a long time and i have also tried to self teach myself how
      to code however school commitments and lack of a developer community to assist in learning i frequently gave up. The main reason why
      i joined Moringa was to not only learn code but also be able to build a startup that i've been trying to launch, the other
      reason is so i can be able to understand my friends' developer insider jokes.   </p>
      <p> I love writting, my hobbies include reading, script writting and videography and making jigsaw puzzles in my free time.
      i also collect funko pops. </p>

      <h2>Journey To Coding</h2>
      <p>My journey to programming started in my second year of university, i wanted to build a magazine vendor app however i knew no developer. I then decided
      to self teach my self how to code unsuccessfuly for the next three years. I fortunately was able to meet a Moringa school technocal mentor as i was looking
      for a developer to build on of my many app ideas, and that was the first time i heard about Moringa School. After graduating from school and after my mandatory
      legal attachments i decided to join Moringa school where i am currently taking my Prep Course. </p>
